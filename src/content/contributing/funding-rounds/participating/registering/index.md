# Registering for funding as an ethereum.org contributor {#registering-for-funding}

As an ethereum.org contributor looking to receive funding during a funding round, there are a couple things you'll need to do **before round allocations begin**:

1. Creating a "project" for yourself
1. Applying to the funding round

## Step 1: Creating a "project" for yourself {#step-1}

First, you'll need to register yourself as a "project" on Gitcoin. This process is about you, and _not yet_ about your contributions to ethereum.orgâ€”you'll get a chance to describe your contribution(s) and provide a receiving address in a later step.

Follow along below, or check out the Gitcoin support docs, _[How to create a project in Builder](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/project-owners/how-to-create-a-project-in-builder)_, for additional guidance.

1. Get connected:

- Go to [Gitcoin Builder New Project](https://builder.gitcoin.co/#/projects/new)
- Connect wallet
- Switch network to **Optimism**

2. Fill out project details:

- _Project Name_ - This is your name, or whatever identifier others will recognize (if youâ€™ve contributed as a team, you can use a team name here)
- _Project Website_ - Link to a social profile, or your website
- _Project Logo, Project Banner_ - _Optional_ avatar and banner images for your project profile page
- _Project Description_ - Describe your interest in ethereum.org, and what potential impact could result from receiving funds

3. Provide socials (optional):

- If youâ€™re contribution involved code contributions or anything on GitHub, it is recommended to provide this for clarity

4. Preview and publish:

- Confirm your details, then "Save and Publish" to submit your transaction on Optimism (requires some ETH on Optimism for transaction fee)

## Step 2: Applying to the round {#step-2}

Once you have a project for yourself, you'll need to apply to an active round. Follow along here, or see the Gitcoin support docs, _[How to apply to a round in Explorer](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/project-owners/how-to-apply-to-a-round-in-explorer)_, for additional guidance.

<!-- TODO: Figure out how to link to round(s) without manual updates here -->
<!-- Explorer link: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/round-contract-address -->

1. Go to [Gitcoin Builder for the current round](https://builder.gitcoin.co/#/chains/10/rounds/round-contract-address)
2. Make sure you're connected to the same wallet used to create your project
3. Review application period and round eligibility, then click **Apply** to continue
4. Select your project from the list
5. **Fill out form details** - Required fields include:
   - _Email address_
   - _Funding sources_ - Must disclose any prior funding for work being submitted
   - _Contribution description_
     - This is your space to describe the contribution(s) youâ€™ve made, and its impact... let people know why your contribution should be valued!
     - **This field has rich-text support using markdown**, so donâ€™t be afraid to express yourself, and make sure users can easily see what youâ€™ve worked on
     - This means you can also embed screenshots using URLs and additional links as needed, though you'll need a place to host these images (i.e. [GitHub](https://github.com), [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), etc.)
     - You can preview your submission in the next step
     - [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
   - _Primary contribution link_ - Link out to publicly available evidence of your contribution. This could be a link to contributions on GitHub, Crowdin, Discord, or directly to a page affected on ethereum.org. You may optionally provide additional URLs in the fields below, or in your contribution description.
6. When finished, click **Preview Application** to continue to preview
7. Review your application, then click **Submit**
8. Once submitted, the entry cannot be changed. Please make sure everything is correct before proceeding. Clicking **Proceed** will submit your transaction on Optimism (requires some ETH on Optimism for transaction fee)
   - To encrypt your data, you must also sign-in again with your walletâ€”this does not cost additional gas

After youâ€™ve applied, youâ€™re submission will enter the review process. You can view your project profile and the status of your application by going to <a href="https://builder.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin Builder</a>.

## Step 3: Spread the word! {#step-3}

<Emoji text="ðŸ“£" fontSize="3xl" me={2} /> Tell others about the round and make sure folks know youâ€™ve applied! Encourage others to check out the round when it goes live and add their voice in how the funds are distributed.

<!-- TODO: Consider a link with a prepared tweet -->

Lastly, when round allocations begin, be sure to also participate as an allocator to get a say in how the funds are distributed!
